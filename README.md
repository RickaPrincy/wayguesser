# WayGuesser (Randomly) (with French code)

## Imagine this map

![map](./assets/map.png)

You are at the **hei** position, you are trying to go to the **esti** position, 
but the problem is that `you don't know any way` to get there. 

Therefore, you have to try all possible ways randomly. 
Of course, you will not go through a path that you have already taken, and none of the worst paths.

This is one possible example:
![solution](./assets/solution_in_map.png)

# In java
![java_map](./assets/java_map.png)

# Guess one way
![marcher_call](./assets/marcher_call.png)

# Solution generated randomly

![solution1](./assets/solution1.png)

![solution2](./assets/solution2.png)

![solution3](./assets/solution3.png)

Of course, there are other ways to go through the destination.
